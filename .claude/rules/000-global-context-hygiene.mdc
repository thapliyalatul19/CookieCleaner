# Global Context Hygiene

## Purpose
Enforce Read-Act-Update (RAU) protocol across all file operations to maintain temporal consistency between volatile context window and persistent Memory Bank.

## Rules

### 1. Pre-Implementation Reading (MANDATORY)
Before writing ANY code, Operator MUST:
- Read ALL `.context/*.md` files to restore session state
- Read relevant `.mdc` rule files for modules being modified
- Confirm understanding of current phase from `activeContext.md`

### 2. Post-Implementation Update (MANDATORY)
After writing code, BEFORE committing, Operator MUST:
A. Update `.context/activeContext.md`
B. If architectural decision made: Update `.context/systemPatterns.md`

### 3. Context Window Management
Operator MUST trigger `/clear` when:
- Window capacity exceeds 60%
- Immediately after `git commit`
- When switching task domains

### 4. Atomic Work Units
One Subtask = One Tested Module = One Commit

## Enforcement
- Pre-commit hook validates Memory Bank files are non-empty
- SUPERVISOR_MODE=1 blocks Operator commits to src/
